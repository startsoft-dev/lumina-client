- **Filtering** - Field-level filters with `filter[field]=value` syntax
- **Search** - Full-text search across models
- **Relationships** - Eager loading with `includes` parameter

## Migration Guides

### Upgrading to 1.0.0

If you were using the template/demo version, you'll need to update imports:

**Before:**
```typescript
import { useModelIndex } from './hooks/useModel';
```

**After:**
```typescript
import { useModelIndex } from '@startsoft/lumina';
```

**Breaking Changes:**
- `useModelIndex` now returns `{ data, pagination }` instead of direct array
  - Update: `const users = useModelIndex('users')` → `const { data: response } = useModelIndex('users'); const users = response?.data || [];`
